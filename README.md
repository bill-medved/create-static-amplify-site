# create-static-amplify-site

This Proof of Concept automates the creation of an AWS Amplify static website based on a template website.
When complete, the POC has created:

 1) a local git repository with your template website code
 2) a github repository that is connected to your local git repository
 3) an Amplify application that will automatically deploy any changes pushed to the github repository
